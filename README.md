Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning

Aim -> The aim of the project is to predict life expectancy rate of a country given various features such as Regional variations, Economic Circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Education, Year of their birth and other demographic factors. This problem statement provides a way to predict average life expectancy of people living in a country when various factors such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths that happened in the country are given. Considering an eclectic combination of all the features I will be able to predict the life expectancy using Machine Learning.
